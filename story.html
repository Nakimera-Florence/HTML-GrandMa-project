    <h3>In painful situations with no one to give you a shoulder to cry on,<br />Remember my words Munchkin-Dimples.(She Said;)</h3>
    <li>The world pays you in propotions to the struggles you are willing to endure. </li>
    <li>Discipline hurts in the moment but regret hurts for life time. </li>
    <li>Pain is not punishment, it's tuition fee for strength. </li>
    <li>Every successful story is built silent struggles and sleepless nights. </li>
    <li>Muscles don't grow without tearing first<ul>
        <li>Growth always demands discomfort</li>
    </ul> </li>
    <li>People embrace lies rather than the truth.You should know when and when not to say!!!<ul>
        <hr /><p>
            <li>Things are not the way you see them.The wrong is right and the right is wrong.</li>
            <li>Somethings need Common sense not Knowledge🫵✌️. </li>
